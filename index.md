This is my 4th year Engineering Design project.

It involves the control of an inverted pendulum using a BeagleBone Black.

The BeagleBone is connected to a Pololu 18v15 simple motor controller and two
400 pulses per revolution (ppr) position encoders.

Reading the position encoders using x4 quadrature encoding gives 1600 ppr and
an angular resolution of 0.23Â°.
